# Minimizing Hallucination in Truth Grounded Scenarios

## Use Cases



The Large language models are used to drive customer insights on use cases not limited to Summarization of text, Automated response generation, Content Generation, Code generation, Code Documentation, Semnatic Search with Embeddings, Information Discovery and Knowledge mining. These uses cases drive business value across various vertical use cases and industries including legal, retail, customer services, call center, entertainment, financial, banking and travel industries. 
Prompt input governance, control and best practices play a significant role in the model output quality and in controlling the model Hallucination

## Challenges

Hallunications is one of major challenge due to its impact on prompt responses quality and relevance as, models produce ourputs that are not based on facts or differ contextualy from the required outcome, these responses can be minor deviations to desired outcome or can produce completely false or divergent outputs.

Huge amounts of data which is prone to noise and errors and can lead to bias,ansence of all the information context in the data, unclear Input prompts can  mislead the model to generate non relevant, inconsistent or contradictory outcome hallucinations.


## Solution Patterns

---
### Pattern 1: (Prompt Governance)
---
#### Approach


An enterose level prompts standaridised governance, design and policy document with Do's, Dont's, examples relevent to organziation use case and policies need to be created, the promots document focuses on creating, precise, and clear input prompt intructions and guradrails  


#### Implementation

[ this does not need to be a fully working implementation, but should provide enough information to understand the approach]

[ provide pseudo code or notebooks, etc. in 'src' directory ]

[ include architecture diagrams in 'assets' directory as needed to illustrate the approach ]

#### Performance

[ discuss / evaluate the performance of the approach (accuracy, speed, etc.) for instance here, use Rouge() or BERTScore()]

#### Strengths

[ discuss the strengths of the approach ]

#### Limitations

[ when does this approach fails or is not recommended ]

### Pattern 2: (name it)
